# Eclipse Angus - Activation

This project provides the implementation of Jakarta Activation Specification
which lets you take advantage of standard services to: determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data;
encapsulate access to it; discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the
appropriate bean to perform the operation(s).

This project is part of [Eclipse Angus project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.angus).
